# Termavan, The Terminal Game of Caravan!

If you, like us, are already a fan of the wonerful Obsidian game Fallout: New Vegas, then you may already know of Caravan.
Caravan is a card game played by many of the wasters, wanderers, and, well, caravaneers that traverse Highway 95. It's been centuries since
anyone's seen a full deck of cards, so contestants use whatever they manage to scrounge up from the waste or trade for caps. Anyway, the rules
are as follows.

## The Rules!

Each player starts with a deck of at least 30 cards, shuffled. Next, they draw draw hands of eight cards. The okayer will start, they can put
a card on each of their 3 caravans. You are trying to keep your caravan between 21 and 26, each cardadds whatever value it is, and the face cards
do weird stuff, which you'll see in a second. The cards must be added in either ascending or descending order, or be the same suit as the one before.
The face cards do the following and can be played on your own cards or your opponent's:


Jack - gets rid of the card you put it on

Queen - reverses pile order

King - doubles the card value

Ace - is just one point

Joker - removes all the card of this type, except the one it's put on

The game ends when one player has two caravans between 21 and 26 that are more valuable then the opponent's corresponding caravan.
